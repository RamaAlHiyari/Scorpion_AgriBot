# Scorpion_AgriBot
Scorpion AgriBot is an Arduino Mega–based rover that autonomously explores crop rows, measures soil moisture via a servo-mounted probe, and avoids obstacles with ultrasonic sensing. Optional ArduCAM captures leaf images, while all readings (time, moisture %, distance, notes, image) are logged as CSV to microSD for offline analysis.
